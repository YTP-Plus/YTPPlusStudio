# ytp+ studio is not yet finished, check back soon!

## ytp+ is an iteration of [ytp+](https://github.com/philosophofee/YTPPlus), written in Lua and made in LÖVE.
### It will include new features and benefits over the [previous iteration](https://github.com/YTP-Plus/YTPPlusPlus) using [ytp+ cli](https://github.com/YTP-Plus/YTPPlusCLI), such as:

  - A new beautifully crafted LÖVE UI.
  - Setting the FPS of a video.
  - NodeJS plugin support with the ability to include NPM modules.
  - Easy installation of all required tools.

## What is ytp+?
[ytp+](https://github.com/YTP-Plus) is the name given to a set of tools to automatically generate machinima-like videos.

ytp+ studio (this repository) is the name given to the third iteration of the software.

[ytp+ cli](https://github.com/YTP-Plus/YTPPlusCLI) is the name given to a CLI application used by ytp+ studio to handle its generation aspect.

## How do I configure ytp+ studio?
All configuration settings may be found in the application itself. For plugin configuration, please refer to its documentation.

## I can't run ytp+ studio!

## I got a great idea for the program, where to start?
Anyone is welcome to submit a pull request or suggest ideas via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8ppmspR6Wh).

## The ytp+ Project
